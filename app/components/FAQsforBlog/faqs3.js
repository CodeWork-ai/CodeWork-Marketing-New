    question: "What is the difference between WorkManager, AlarmManager, and JobScheduler in Android?",
    answer: [
      "WorkManager is a modern solution for deferrable and guaranteed background tasks, AlarmManager is best for exact time-based execution, and JobScheduler is ideal for condition-based background tasks from Android 5.0 onwards.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "When should I use WorkManager in Android app development?",
    answer: [
      "Use WorkManager for tasks like data syncing, file backups, or periodic maintenance, especially when tasks need to be guaranteed even after app restarts or device reboots.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Can AlarmManager run background tasks when the device is idle?",
    answer: [
      "Yes, AlarmManager can wake the device from idle state and execute tasks at specified times. However, it may consume more battery and has limitations due to Doze Mode.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What are the advantages of using JobScheduler over AlarmManager?",
    answer: [
      "JobScheduler is more battery-efficient and supports condition-based execution such as network availability or charging status. It also supports persistence across device reboots.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Is WorkManager better than JobScheduler for background tasks in Android?",
    answer: [
      "Yes, WorkManager is generally preferred as it combines the best features of JobScheduler and AlarmManager while offering compatibility across all Android API levels and guaranteed task execution.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How do I schedule a periodic background task using WorkManager in Android?",
    answer: [
      "You can use PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder to schedule recurring tasks with constraints like unmetered network and charging. WorkManager ensures these tasks are executed reliably.",
    ],
