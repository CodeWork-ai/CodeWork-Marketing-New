      question: "What is Mixture of Experts (MoE) in AI?",
      answer: [
        "MoE is an AI architecture where only a few specialized sub-models (\"experts\") are activated for each task, making AI more efficient compared to running the entire model.",
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "How does Mixture of Experts work?",
      answer: [
        "MoE uses a gating network to select the most relevant experts, activates them with sparse activation, and then aggregates their outputs to produce the result.",
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "What are some real-world examples of MoE models?",
      answer: [
        "Examples include Mixtral 8x7B (for text generation and reasoning), DBRX by Databricks (for code and math), and DeepSeek-V2 (for long document processing).",
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of using MoE?",
      answer: [
        "MoE makes AI models more efficient, enables faster inference, allows smarter task specialization, and supports flexible scaling by adding experts when needed.",
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "Why is MoE important for the future of AI?",
      answer: [
        "MoE shows that progress in AI isn't just about making bigger modelsâ€”it's about making smarter, cost-effective, and specialized models that perform better with fewer resources.",
      ],
