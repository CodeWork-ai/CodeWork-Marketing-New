      question: "How accurate is underground mapping?",
      answer: [
        "Accuracy depends on the method and conditions. In favorable environments, errors can be as small as a few centimeters. In difficult soils, accuracy may be reduced.",
      ],

      question: "Can the public access underground maps?",
      answer: [
        "Access is limited. Some municipalities allow homeowners or contractors to request utility maps, but full records are often restricted for safety and security reasons.",
      ],
    },
    {
      question: "What standards are followed?",
      answer: [
        "In some regions, standards such as PAS 128 (UK) define survey accuracy levels. Following standards ensures consistency and reliability in mapping results.",

      question: "How much does underground mapping cost?",
      answer: [
        "Costs vary depending on site size, complexity, and required technologies. While initial surveys may add expense, they often save money by preventing costly utility damage.",

      question: "Who uses underground mapping?",

        "Engineers, contractors, utility companies, and city planners are the main users. Increasingly, environmental and archaeological teams also rely on these methods.",
