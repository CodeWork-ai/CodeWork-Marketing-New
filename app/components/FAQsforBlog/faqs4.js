  {
    question: "What exactly is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in simple terms?",
    answer: [
      "MCP is like a GPS for AI conversations â€” it helps AI understand where it is in a conversation and how to respond appropriately by keeping track of context, user intent, and prior interactions.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How is MCP different from traditional AI models?",
    answer: [
      "Traditional AI models often rely on isolated inputs, treating each query as a standalone. MCP-enhanced systems, however, use conversational history and environmental context to tailor responses, making interactions feel more natural and relevant.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Where is MCP used in everyday applications?",
    answer: [
      "You experience MCP in action when a chatbot remembers your last support request, or when Netflix recommends movies based on your recent viewing history. It's behind smarter voice assistants, personalized shopping suggestions, and contextual customer service.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Does MCP improve AI's accuracy?",
    answer: [
      "Yes. By understanding the full context of a request, including previous conversations, user preferences, and environment, MCP significantly improves the relevance and precision of AI responses.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How will MCP shape the future of AI?",
    answer: [
      "MCP is paving the way for hyper-personalized AI interactions. As it evolves, we'll see AI systems that understand not just commands but emotions, habits, and goals, resulting in more intuitive, human-like digital experiences.",
    ],
