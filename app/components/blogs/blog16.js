        {/* INTRODUCTION */}
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Deep learning is a part of machine learning that uses multiple-layered neural networks to imitate the human brain’s decision-making process. It plays a key role in powering many artificial intelligence applications we use in our daily lives. Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning models can automatically learn features and patterns from raw data—such as images, audio, or text—without human intervention. This technology powers many advanced applications today, including facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and real-time language translation.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: How Does Deep Learning Work? */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">How Does Deep Learning Work?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Deep learning models use multiple layers of artificial neurons to process data. Each layer processes the input in a specific way and then passes the output to the following layer. This layered approach allows the model to learn complex patterns and representations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For instance, in image recognition, the initial layer may detect edges, the next layer captures geometric patterns, and the final layer categorizes objects such as traffic signs or medical scans.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Feel free to ask if you'd like an example from another area, such as retail, security, or industrial automation. I can adjust it to suit your needs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Neural networks become more effective as they receive larger datasets and greater computational resources, which makes them ideal for complex and demanding tasks.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Types of Deep Learning Models */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Types of Deep Learning Models</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Deep learning models use artificial neural networks to identify and learn intricate patterns from vast amounts of data. These models replicate the way the human brain interprets information and are widely used in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The following are the primary categories of deep learning models.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Image and video recognition, medical image analysis, and object detection. <br />
          CNNs are specifically designed to process pixel data. They use layers that automatically detect patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Used in facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and MRI scan analysis.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Time-series data, text processing, and speech recognition. <br />
          Recurrent neural networks are well suited for data that unfolds over time, where the sequence of information plays an important role. They have loops in their structure, allowing information to persist. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Used in language translation, chatbots, and stock market predictions.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">3. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Long-term sequential data. <br />
          LSTMs are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. They solve the vanishing gradient problem faced by traditional RNNs. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Creating written content, composing musical pieces, and producing spoken audio.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Generating realistic data like images, videos, and audio. <br />
          GANs consist of two networks – a generator and a discriminator – that compete with each other. This setup allows for the generation of artificial data that closely mimics actual data. Examples include producing realistic visual content, improving image quality, and generating artistic designs.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">5. Autoencoders</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> Data compression and noise reduction. <br />
          Autoencoders learn to compress and then reconstruct data. They're often used for dimensionality reduction and detecting anomalies in data. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Denoising images, fraud detection, and feature extraction.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">6. Transformers</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Best for:</strong> NLP tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis. <br />
          Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to examine how each word relates to every other word in a sentence. These technologies serve as the core of models such as BERT and GPT. Examples include conversational agents, online search tools, and systems for understanding language.
        </p>
