        {/* INTRODUCTION */}
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Predictive analytics is a powerful branch of data science that utilizes statistical techniques, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. It helps businesses and organizations make smarter decisions by identifying patterns and trends before they happen.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          From predicting customer churn to forecasting product demand, predictive analytics transforms raw data into actionable insights. With the rise of advanced AI algorithms, this approach is being used across industries to gain a competitive edge.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Types of Predictive Modeling */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Types of Predictive Modeling</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Predictive modeling is a vital part of data science and machine learning. It uses historical data to forecast future events or behaviors. Let’s dive into the most commonly used types of predictive models, each designed for specific outcomes and data structures.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">1. Classification Models</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Classification models are used when the output variable is categorical, meaning it belongs to a specific group or class. The model assigns input data to predefined categories.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>How it Works:</strong> By learning patterns from labeled data, the model can predict whether new data points fall under category A or B (or more).
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Imagine you're running an e-commerce site and want to predict whether a visitor will click an ad or not. The model will classify users into "click" or "no-click" based on past behavior, device type, and demographics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Common Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Logistic Regression</li>
          <li>Decision Trees</li>
          <li>Random Forest</li>
          <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">2. Regression Models</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Regression models are used for continuous numerical predictions. They estimate relationships between variables.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>How it Works:</strong> The model analyzes past numerical data to detect patterns and trends, enabling accurate prediction of future outcomes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Example Use Case:</strong> The company seeks to forecast its sales revenue for the upcoming quarter. Using past sales data, marketing spend, and seasonal trends, a regression model estimates future figures.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Common Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Linear Regression</li>
          <li>Lasso Regression</li>
          <li>Ridge Regression</li>
          <li>Polynomial Regression</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">3. Time Series Models</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Time series models are ideal for data that’s collected chronologically, helping to analyze trends and make sequential forecasts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>How it Works:</strong> These models understand how values change over time. They account for seasonality, trends, and patterns in time-based data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Predicting energy usage or stock market trends by analyzing data from previous months or years.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Common Models:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</li>
          <li>Prophet (by Facebook)</li>
          <li>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network model designed to process and predict patterns in sequential data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">4. Clustering Models</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Unlike classification, clustering models are unsupervised and group similar data points together without prior labeling.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>How it Works:</strong> These models uncover hidden patterns by grouping data into clusters or segments with similar features.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Customer segmentation for marketing. A company can cluster users based on age, spending habits, or behavior to tailor marketing campaigns.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Popular Algorithms:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>K-Means</li>
          <li>DBSCAN</li>
          <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">5. Neural Network Models</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> These are advanced predictive models designed to mimic the human brain’s structure. They handle large volumes of complex, unstructured data like images, audio, and text.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>How it Works:</strong> Neural networks process and learn from data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes, often referred to as ‘neurons’. Deep learning models can capture intricate patterns and nonlinear relationships.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Example Use Case:</strong> Image recognition in Healthcare (detecting tumors), Sentiment analysis in social media, Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Popular Architectures:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) – great for image data</li>
          <li>RNN/LSTM – for sequences like text or speech</li>
          <li>Transformers – used in modern language models</li>
        </ul>
