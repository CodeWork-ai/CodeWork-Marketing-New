              Remember when your biggest worry was just getting everyone to use the same project management tool? Those days feel quaint now. Last year, I watched my colleague Sarah turn a team of AI skeptics into enthusiasts—not through fancy presentations, but by genuinely caring about their concerns and fears.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              I'll be brutally honest: I used to think AI implementation was about choosing the right tools and following best practices. I was wrong. The sleepless nights don't come from technical glitches—they come from seeing talented team members worry they're becoming obsolete.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              When you're managing an AI project, you're not just a project manager. You become part therapist, part cheerleader, and part fortune teller, trying to help people see a future they can't quite imagine yet.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your team is having real conversations about AI, whether you're part of them or not. Here's what they're actually saying:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-white/80 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>"Am I going to lose my job?"</strong> This isn't dramatic—it's human. When Jessica from our QA team first saw AI running test cases, she went quiet for days. It wasn't until we showed her how it freed her up for the detective work she loved that she started asking questions instead of planning her exit strategy.</li>
              <li><strong>"I feel stupid asking this, but..."</strong> The smartest people on your team might feel the most intimidated. They're used to being experts, and suddenly they're beginners again. Create space for these vulnerable moments—they're where real learning happens.</li>
              <li><strong>"Here we go again with another shiny tool."</strong> Some team members have survived multiple "transformational" initiatives. Their skepticism isn't personal—it's learned. They need to see genuine commitment, not just enthusiasm.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-white/80 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Tell them why this matters—really matters:</strong> Skip the buzzwords about "competitive advantage." Tell them about the late nights you won't have to work, the boring tasks they won't have to repeat, and the creative challenges they'll finally have time to tackle.</li>
              <li><strong>Let them play, not just learn:</strong> Give people sandbox environments where they can mess around with AI tools without consequences. Some of our best implementations came from developers experimenting during lunch breaks.</li>
              <li><strong>Make heroes out of early wins:</strong> When someone saves hours using an AI tool, don't just mention it in passing. Tell the story. Make it real. People need to see themselves in these success stories.</li>

            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-white/80 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Find your natural allies:</strong> Every team has someone who loves trying new things. They're not necessarily your star performers—they're your bridge builders. Invest in them first.</li>
              <li><strong>Treat learning like growth, not catching up:</strong> Frame AI training as professional development, not remedial education. Partner with HR to make it part of career advancement, not survival.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't forget you're all human:</strong> Digital transformation can feel cold and impersonal. Double down on team connections. More coffee chats, more check-ins, more "how are you really doing?"</li>

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You can't be the AI expert—that's not your job. Your job is being the people expert. The one who notices when someone's struggling, celebrates when they succeed, and keeps everyone focused on why this matters.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Be patient with the process. Trust happens slowly, then all at once.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Six months later, my team doesn't just use AI tools—they advocate for them. Not because the technology is perfect, but because they felt supported through the change. That's the difference between successful AI projects and expensive experiments.
