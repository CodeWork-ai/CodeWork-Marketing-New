            <p className="text-white/80 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of machines to carry out tasks that usually demand human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, recognizing patterns, making decisions, understanding language, and interacting with humans. Unlike traditional systems that follow fixed rules, AI adapts over time, improving its performance through experience. It combines various technologies and approaches to replicate human cognitive abilities such as perception, reasoning, and problem-solving.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Machine Learning: The Core of AI</h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Machine Learning (ML) plays a vital role at the core of Artificial Intelligence. It enables machines to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed for every task. ML systems identify patterns, make predictions, and continuously improve based on feedback.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              There are three major types of machine learning:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-white/80 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The system is trained on labeled data; the input and correct output are already known. This helps the model learn accurate predictions, such as identifying spam emails.</li>
              <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> This approach finds patterns in unlabeled data. It is useful for discovering hidden groupings, such as customer segmentation in marketing.</li>
              <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The system learns through trial and error by receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for mistakes. It is often used in robotics and game-playing AI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Machine learning powers many tools we use today, including recommendation engines, fraud detection, and predictive analytics.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Deep Learning: Mimicking the Brain</h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks have multiple layers that process and learn from large volumes of data.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Deep learning is powerful when dealing with complex inputs such as images, sound, and text. It is the technology behind facial recognition, voice assistants, automatic language translation, and even self-driving cars. By learning from vast datasets, deep learning models can achieve remarkable accuracy in tasks once considered impossible for machines.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Generative AI refers to systems that don't just analyze data—they create new content. These models can generate human-like text, realistic images, music, and even software code. Examples include tools like ChatGPT for conversations, or DALL·E, which creates images based on text prompts.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              These systems are trained on massive datasets and use transformer-based architectures to learn how language and visuals work. Generative AI is revolutionizing content creation, marketing, product design, and entertainment by allowing faster, scalable, and personalized outputs.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              AI agents are independent systems that observe their surroundings and act accordingly to accomplish defined objectives. Agentic AI is a more advanced form where these agents can plan multi-step actions, collaborate, and adapt to changing conditions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              These agents are applied across multiple domains, including virtual assistants for task scheduling, chatbots offering round-the-clock customer support, and smart logistics systems that streamline delivery operations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              In the future, agentic AI may drive self-managed systems that work alongside humans in more dynamic ways.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Artificial Intelligence brings many advantages to individuals, businesses, and society. One of the most notable benefits is speed—AI can analyze vast amounts of data and make decisions faster than humans. It also supports automation by taking over repetitive, time-consuming tasks, allowing people to focus on higher-value work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              AI improves precision by reducing human errors, particularly in fields such as medical diagnosis and data processing. It also enables personalization, tailoring services and experiences based on user behavior.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              In addition, AI offers strong predictive abilities that enable businesses to anticipate trends, avoid potential issues, and make more informed strategic choices.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Despite its many benefits, AI also presents significant challenges. One of the major concerns is bias—AI systems can unintentionally reflect human prejudices present in training data. Privacy is another critical issue, especially when sensitive personal information is involved.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              There's also the risk of job displacement as automation replaces certain roles. Security vulnerabilities can make AI systems targets for adversarial attacks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Finally, a lack of transparency in how some AI models make decisions can create trust issues, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare or law.
