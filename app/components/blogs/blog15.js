        {/* INTRODUCTION */}
        <p className="text-white/80 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), empowers machines to learn from experience, operate independently, and enhance accuracy through exposure to data. It uses algorithms to identify patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on data. Whether in voice assistants, recommendation engines, or fraud detection, machine learning is revolutionizing industries globally.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Understanding the Differences in AI Concepts */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Understanding the Differences in AI Concepts</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Although commonly used as synonyms, these terms refer to distinct concepts. Machine learning is a broader field. Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses layered neural networks to model complex patterns. Neural networks mimic the human brain. They serve as the foundation for deep learning applications such as image recognition and language understanding.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Key Approaches in Machine Learning */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Key Approaches in Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. Supervised Learning</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In this method, the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. Each example in the data includes both the input and the correct output. The algorithm’s job is to learn the relationship so it can predict future results. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> A spam filter that learns which emails are spam (based on past labeled examples).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Here, the data does not have labeled outputs. The system independently uncovers patterns or clusters within the data. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Grouping customers based on their behavior without knowing their buying history (customer segmentation).
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This type is based on reward and punishment. The algorithm evaluates outcomes, reinforcing successful actions while discouraging incorrect ones. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> A self-driving car learning how to park by trial and error.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Top Machine Learning Algorithms to Know</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Widely Used Algorithms in ML Projects</h3>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. Linear Regression</h4>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A basic algorithm that shows the relationship between two variables. It predicts a numeric value (such as a house price) based on input (like the size of the house).
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Decision Trees</h4>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          These are like flowcharts. They split the data based on conditions and help in classification or prediction tasks. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Deciding if a person will buy a product based on age, income, and browsing history.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Random Forest</h4>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A group (or forest) of decision trees is combined to improve accuracy and reduce errors in predictions.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">4. K-Means Clustering</h4>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In unsupervised learning, algorithms automatically group similar data points into clusters, identifying patterns without prior knowledge of what to look for. <br />
          <strong>Example:</strong> Grouping songs based on listening behavior.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h4>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A powerful classification method that draws a boundary between categories of data, making sure the margin between them is as wide as possible.
        </p>
