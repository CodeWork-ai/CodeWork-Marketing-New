        {/* INTRODUCTION */}
        <p className="text-white/80 text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Artificial intelligence (AI) transforms software development by offering tools and practices that increase efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. AI is transforming software development by <Link href="/code-generation-automation" className="text-secondary hover:text-secondary/80 underline font-medium">automating coding</Link>, simplifying testing, and improving deployment workflows.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Generative AI in Development - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">The Role of Generative AI in Development</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Artificial Intelligence, especially <Link href="/code-generation-automation" className="text-secondary hover:text-secondary/80 underline font-medium">generative AI</Link> and large language models, speeds up the software development process by automating important stages such as idea generation, requirement gathering, coding, and testing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Gen AI works in partnership with human developers to turn ideas into needs. It then translates those requirements into user stories, generates test cases, code, and documentation—accelerating development and improving product quality.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: AI in Code Generation - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">AI and Code Generation</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI has a major impact on code generation. Technologies powered by <Link href="/machine-learning" className="text-secondary hover:text-secondary/80 underline font-medium">machine learning</Link> use natural language processing to understand written descriptions and provide code suggestions or even generate complete code. This speeds up development, reduces human error, and frees developers to focus on creative problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI-powered autocompletion and code synthesis tools predict code lines or create full functions. As they learn from vast datasets, these tools become more efficient over time, contributing to faster and more effective development cycles.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: AI in Testing and Debugging - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Smarter Debugging and Testing</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Beyond coding, AI technologies improve debugging and testing. Advanced AI tools can detect bugs, uncover inefficiencies, and suggest improvements. AI-driven testing systems create adaptive test cases and prioritize critical tests—resulting in stronger software quality and enhanced security.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI can forecast errors based on historical data, helping engineers avoid future problems. These systems use machine learning algorithms to improve test processes by analyzing data from past incidents.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: AI in DevOps and Management - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Enhancing DevOps and Project Management</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI supports project management and DevOps by automating repetitive tasks, improving time estimation, and streamlining CI/CD pipelines. AI-powered tools enhance resource allocation, task scheduling, and real-time performance monitoring to prevent deployment issues.
        </p>

        {/* SECTION: Specialized AI Development Tools - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Emerging AI Development Frameworks</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI development has introduced specialized frameworks that help programmers build more reliable and efficient AI applications using various programming languages. These tools allow developers to integrate advanced AI capabilities seamlessly into their projects.
        </p>

        {/* FINAL THOUGHTS - Keep 2xl */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          All things considered, AI is improving development speed and accuracy while creating a more dependable and secure software environment. As AI continues to evolve, it may completely redefine software development processes and potentially make traditional agile methods obsolete.
