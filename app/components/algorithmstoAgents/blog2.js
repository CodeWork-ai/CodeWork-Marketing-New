            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in today's world. From language models that can write poetry to autonomous systems solving complex problems, AI is revolutionizing the way we live, work, and create. But how did we get here? In this blog, we'll take a journey through AI's history, from its humble beginnings to the groundbreaking innovations that define the field today.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              AI as a concept isn't new. The term was first coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where researchers dreamt of machines capable of reasoning, learning, and problem-solving like humans. Early efforts focused on rule-based systems and symbolic reasoning, which were great for well-defined problems like chess but struggled with ambiguity and complexity. The 1980s and 90s brought us machine learning (ML), where algorithms could learn patterns from data rather than relying on rigid rules. But even then, AI's potential felt limited by computational power and the availability of data.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Deep Learning Revolution</h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              Everything changed in the 2010s with the advent of deep learning, a subset of ML inspired by the structure of the human brain. Neural networks had existed for decades, but breakthroughs like increased GPU processing power and massive datasets allowed them to flourish. The seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" in 2017 introduced transformers, a game-changing architecture. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process data in parallel, making them faster and more effective at handling sequential tasks. The concept of "attention," which enables models to focus on the most relevant parts of input data, unlocked new possibilities for natural language processing (NLP).

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Rise of Large Language Models</h2>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              The transformer architecture paved the way for models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). OpenAI's GPT-2 and GPT-3 demonstrated that language models could generate coherent, human-like text. This was more than just a technical achievement, it showed that AI could understand context, making it useful for everything from drafting emails to writing code.
              <br/><br/>
              Around the same time, open-source efforts like Hugging Face's transformers library democratized access to these tools, enabling researchers and developers worldwide to experiment with state-of-the-art NLP. However, the rise of large-scale, closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet underscored the increasing resource demands and proprietary nature of cutting-edge AI development.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Today, we're witnessing a shift from standalone models to autonomous AI agents. Tools like LangChain, Llama_index and frameworks like OpenAI's Function Calling allow models to interact with APIs, databases, and even other AI systems. These agents can complete complex tasks by reasoning, planning, and executing actions dynamically.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">For example, AI agents can now:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 text-white font-medium">
              <li>Plan and book your travel itinerary</li>
              <li>Debug and write entire software programs</li>
              <li>Collaborate with humans in research, design, and problem-solving</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
              This evolution signifies a move toward more general-purpose AI systems capable of not just answering questions but taking meaningful action.

            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The AI community today is divided between open-source and closed-source models. Open-source initiatives like Meta's LLaMA models and OpenAssistant emphasize accessibility and collaboration. On the other hand, closed-source models often push the boundaries of capability but are locked behind paywalls and licensing restrictions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">Both approaches have their merits:</p>
